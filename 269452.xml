<title>Asmodee Publisher List</title>
<description>[size=24][center][b]Please read the details in the description and comments for each entry, don&apos;t just glance at the titles[/b][/center][/size]

I&apos;m not saying you should boycott these publishers&apos; games, I&apos;m just listing them for informational purposes. 

This list started as a list of publishers listed on Asmodee&apos;s North America site.  There was a [thread=2372161]thread[/thread] about their latest change in business practices and people were saying they would like such a list.

I&apos;ve opened up the list so other users can add items. I&apos;m hoping no one gets added to this list without real research/knowledge first.  I do NOT have time to police all the entries so hopefully other users will chime in if someone posts something that doesn&apos;t belong on this list and the original poster will edit it as necessary.  

To keep the list as concise as possible, I&apos;ve listed only PUBLISHERS as the main entries. Games can be listed as comments or something under the main entries.

[user=zachpas][/user] is much better at this kind of thing than I am.  Please follow their example and list some kind of justification for adding an item to the list.


[user=hexahedron][/user] added much more information to this list than I did and had some good ideas that I&apos;ve implemented.  

My apologies to anyone who has subscribed to this list for the multiple edits I&apos;ve made to the header/title... I think I&apos;m done now and will just let the community to their thing from now on.

[center][b]UPDATE**** March-ish 2020[/b][/center]
Plaid Hat has &apos;divorced&apos; from Asmodee. They will remain with Asmodee for distribution, but a previous owner has bought back most of the company (had to give up the games developed during their time with Asmodee), and they are taking control of their own parts replacement. </body>

From Google Translate:

&quot;Essen, Walldürn, 2 January 2017 - Asmodee and Heidelberger Spieleverlag are proud to announce their merger. Since both publishers have been working closely together in logistics since August 2015, the merger is the perfect step towards furthering their joint success. ...&quot;


https://heidelbaer.de/en/heidelbar-games-becomes-independent-publisher/

They were acquired by Asmodee in 2017 under the Heidelberger Spieleverlag name. Then they split back off in March 2019 under the new HeidelBÄR Games name, but it appears Asmodee is still their distributor.</body>

~Dec 2016, via Google Translate:

&quot; Good news!
Edge Entertainment joins the Asmodee group

Dear Friends,

We start the year with good news! Edge Entertainment joins the Asmodee group.

After several of our international partners (Fantasy Flight Games, Days of Wonder, Ystari or Plaid Hat Games, for example) have joined the Asmodee group, we consider this to be the natural step in our development; continue our work with those who in some cases have been our partners for a whole decade, to continue growing with them and give full continuity to the work we have been doing for more than fifteen years.

Joining this great family will mean increasing our resources to make more and better games available to you, and being able to respond to the challenges presented by the future in a more appropriate way.

We will continue to take care of the localization of all the international publishing houses we currently represent to Spanish, and we will be adding more to our catalog over time. Likewise, we will increase our own game production, which thanks to the union of the Asmodee group will be automatically internationalized.

Finally, we want to tell you that our union has been carried out together with that of our sister publisher in France, our distributor in Spain (Millennium) and our counterparts in Germany, Heidelberger Spieleverlag. In this way, cooperation with these companies, which goes back to our origins, is reinforced with the incorporation of all to the same group.

In spite of everything, you will not notice changes in the short term, since our publications will follow each other normally and will continue to be distributed through the same channels. We remain the same group of people doing the same: try to put as many games as possible at your disposal.

We take this opportunity to transfer the best wishes of the Edge Entertainment team to you, your family and friends during 2017.

Happy New Year! &quot;</body>

&quot; Asmodee and Asterion merge to develop Italian Board Game Market.
Guyancourt (France); Correggio (Italy); February 10th [2015]

Founded by Massimo Bianchini and Luca Cattini, Asterion publishes and distributes boardgames. The company has
distributed most of Asmodee’s games since 2010, when the Italian version of Dixit was launched. The strong
connection and close relationship between the two companies as well as their shared perspective on the future of
boardgames in Italy enabled an open dialogue that led to the purchase of Asterion by Asmodee. &quot;

The only press release was about them &quot;entering discussions&quot; for a merger, but it doesn&apos;t seem like anybody turns down Asmodee... This article from May 2019 says that ADC Blackfire&apos;s accessory products (they&apos;re primarily a distributor, but have some of their own unique games and accessories too) are being shuffled around within Asmodee to a new division, so it sounds like the acquisition succeeded.

&quot; ASMODEE LAUNCHES GAMING ACCESSORY PRODUCTION STUDIO, Gamegenic
Posted by William Niebling on May 23, 2019 @ 7:24 pm CT

Asmodee has announced the creation of a new studio that will be part of its family of companies. Gamegenic will specialize in the development and production of game accessories.
Gamegenic will produce a line of premium accessories for games and licensed products, including card sleeves and albums, playmats, storage boxes, and dice.  The company plans to offer a diverse portfolio, including products for different price segments.  Its line will include items targeted towards new game players and those geared for more experienced collectors.  Gamegenic accessories will be sold both directly to consumers and through trade distribution.
The new studio will take over the production and development of accessories for the entire Asmodee Group, including the product lines formerly produced by Fantasy Flight and Blackfire. &quot;

(Gamegenic doesn&apos;t seem to have a publisher entry available on BGG currently. Its products include many [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2278124/gamegenic-keyforge-range-under-spotlight-videos]Keyforge accessories[/url] which could be added to the database.)

&quot; Asmodee UK purchases Coiledspring Games
Posted on 27 Mar 2018

Asmodee UK have purchased fellow UK games distributor Coiledspring Games. The change in ownership, which is effective immediately, sees Coiledspring join the Asmodee Group of games companies across the world.

Founded in 2004, with just one game and one puzzle, Coiledspring have gone on to become a leading name in UK games distribution, carrying a wide range of products also including jigsaws, puzzles and soft toys.
Following the acquisition, Coiledspring will continue to operate as a separate entity, run at arm’s length from Asmodee UK’s current operations. &quot;
